1.Although pagination is a great way to handle loads of data, I find that the infinite scroll model used by companies such as Meta, Tiktok provide for a richer user experience.

2.I would add a way for users to filter movies via genres.
3.I would create the details page for each movie.
4.I would create a sorting mechanism to allow users to sort alphabetically or chronologivally
